# Contributing to DEV-LENS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DEV-LENS! We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels. This guide will help you get started with contributing to our AI-powered code review platform.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Fork and Clone

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DEV-LENS.git
   cd DEV-LENS
   ```
3. **Add the original repository** as upstream:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/H0NEYP0T-466/DEV-LENS.git
   ```

### Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names like:
- `feature/add-python-support`
- `bugfix/fix-api-timeout`
- `docs/update-installation-guide`

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v16.0.0 or higher
- **npm** package manager
- **Git**
- **Google Gemini API Key** (for AI functionality)

### Environment Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Backend dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Create environment file**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp .env.example .env  # If available, otherwise create manually
   echo "geminiApiKey=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

3. **Start development servers**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend server
   cd backend
   npm start
   
   # Terminal 2: Frontend server
   cd ..
   npm run dev
   ```

### Running Tests

Currently, the project uses manual testing. When running your changes:

1. **Test the frontend** at `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Test the API** at `http://localhost:8000`
3. **Verify all features** work as expected
4. **Test on different browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
5. **Test responsive design** on mobile devices

## üìù Code Style and Standards

### ESLint Configuration

We use ESLint for code quality and consistency:

```bash
# Lint your code before committing
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues where possible
npm run lint -- --fix
```

### Code Style Guidelines

- **JavaScript**: Use ES6+ features, arrow functions where appropriate
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks
- **CSS**: Use consistent naming conventions and organize styles logically
- **File Naming**: Use descriptive names, follow existing patterns
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic, avoid obvious comments

### Code Quality Checklist

- [ ] Code follows existing style patterns
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented
- [ ] Components are properly modularized
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants/config)
- [ ] Code is readable and well-commented

## üíª Commit Message Convention

We follow the Conventional Commits specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect code meaning (white-space, formatting)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
feat: add Python syntax highlighting support
fix: resolve API timeout issues on large code files
docs: update installation instructions for Windows
style: format code according to ESLint rules
refactor: extract AI response parsing logic into separate module
```
